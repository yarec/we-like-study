INSERT INTO `exam_question` VALUES ('459', '0', '7', '27', '0.0', ' &nbsp; &nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><strong>A Grassroots Remedy</strong></div><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Most of us spend our lives seeking the natural world. To this end, we walk the dog, play golf, go fishing, sit in the garden, drink outside rather than inside the pub, have a picnic, live in the suburbs, go to the seaside, buy a weekend place in the country. The most popular leisure activity in Britain is going for a walk. And when joggers(慢跑者) jog, they don&#39;t run the streets. Every one of them instinctively heads to the park or the river. It is my profound belief that not only do we all need nature, but we all seek nature, whether we know we are doing so or not.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;But despite this, our children are growing up nature-deprived (丧失). I spent my boyhood climbing trees on Streatham Common, South London. These days, children are robbed of these ancient freedoms, due to problems like crime, traffic, the loss of the open spaces and odd new perceptions about what is best for children, that is to say, things that can be bought, rather than things that can be found.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The truth is to be found elsewhere. A study in the US: families had moved to better housing and the children were assessed for ADHD—attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (多动症). Those whose accommodation had more natural views showed an improvement of 19%; those who had the same improvement in material surroundings but no nice view improved just 4%.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;A study in Sweden indicated that kindergarten children who could play in a natural environment had less illness and greater physical ability than children used only to a normal playground. A US study suggested that when a school gave children access to a natural environment, academic levels were raised across the entire school.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Another study found that children play differently in a natural environment. In playgrounds, children create a hierarchy(等级) based on physical abilities, with the tough ones taking the lead. But when a grassy area was planted with bushes, the children got much more into fantasy play, and the social hierarchy was now based on imagination and creativity.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Most bullying(恃强凌弱)is found in schools where there is a tarmac(柏油碎石) playground; the least bullying is in a natural area that the children are encouraged to explore. This reminds me unpleasantly of Sunnyhill School in Streatham, with its harsh tarmac, where I used to hang about in corners fantasising about wildlife.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;But children are frequently discouraged from involvement with natural spaces, for health and safety reasons, for fear that they might get dirty or that they might cause damage. So, instead, the damage is done to the children themselves: not to their bodies but to their souls.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the great problems of modern childhood is ADHD, now increasingly and expensively treated with drugs.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet one study after another indicates that contact with nature gives huge benefits to ADHD children. However, we spend money on drugs rather than on green places.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The life of old people is measurably better when they have access to nature. The increasing emphasis for the growing population of old people is in quality rather than quantity of years. And study after study finds that a garden is the single most important thing in finding that quality.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;In wider and more difficult areas of life, there is evidence to indicate that natural surroundings improve all kinds of things. Even problems with crime and aggressive behaviour are reduced when there is contact with the natural world.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Dr William Bird, researcher from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, states in his study, \"A natural environment can reduce violent behaviour because its restorative process helps reduce anger and impulsive behaviour. \" Wild places need encouraging for this reason, no matter how small their contribution.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;We tend to look on nature conservation as some kind of favour that human beings are granting to the natural world. The error here is far too deep: not only do humans need nature for themselves, but the very idea that humanity and the natural world are separable things is profoundly damaging.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Human beings are a species of mammals(哺乳动物). For seven million years they lived on the planet as part of nature. Our ancestral selves miss the natural world and long for contact with nonhuman life. Anyone who has patted a dog, stroked a eat, sat under a tree with a pint of beer, given or received a bunch of flowers or chosen to walk through the park on a nice day, understands that.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;We need the wild world. It is essential to our well-being, our health, our happiness. Without the wild world we are not more but less civilised. Without other living things around us we are less than human.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Five ways to find harmony with the natural world</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Walk: Break the rhythm of permanently being under a roof. Get off a stop earlier, make a circuit of the park at lunchtime, walk the child to and from school, get a dog, feel yourself moving in moving air, look, listen, absorb.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Sit: Take a moment, every now and then, to be still in an open space. In the garden, anywhere that&#39;s not in the office, anywhere out of the house, away from the routine. Sit under a tree, look at water, feel refreshed, ever so slightly renewed.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Drink: The best way to enjoy the natural world is by yourself; the second best way is in company. Take a drink outside with a good person, a good gathering: talk with the sun and the wind with birdsong for background.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Learn: Expand your boundaries. Learn five species of bird, five butterflies, five trees, five bird songs. That way, you see and hear more: and your mind responds gratefully to the greater amount of wildness in your life.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Travel: The places you always wanted to visit: by the seaside, in the country, in the hills. Take a weekend break, a day-trip, get out there and do it: for the scenery, for the way through the woods, for the birds, for the bees. Go somewhere special and bring specialness home.

Thus, they learn early to hide vulnerable emotions such as love, joy and sadness because they believe that such feelings are feminine and imply weakness. Over time, some men become strangers to their own emotional lives. It seems that men with traditional views of masculinity are more likely to suppress outward emotions and to fear emotions, supposedly because such feelings may lead to a loss of composure(镇定). Keep in mind, however, that this view is challenged by some researchers. As with many gender gaps, differences in emotionality tend to be small, inconsistent, and dependent on the situation. For instance, Robertson and his, colleagues found that males who were more traditionally masculine were more emotionally expressive in a structured exercise than when they were simply asked to talk about their emotions.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Male&#39;s difficulty with \"tender\" emotions has serious consequences. First, suppressed emotions can contribute to stress-related disorders. And worse, men are less likely than women to seek help from health professionals. Second, men&#39;s emotional inexpressiveness can cause problems in their relationships with partners and children. For example, men who endorse traditional masculine norms report lower relationship satisfaction, as do their female partners. Further, children whose fathers are warm, loving and accepting toward them have higher self-esteem and lower rates of aggression and behavior problems. On a positive note, fathers are increasingly involving themselves with their children. And 30 percent of fathers report that they take equal or greater responsibility for their children than their working wives do.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;One emotion males are allowed to express is anger. Sometimes this anger translates into physical aggression or violence.

The UN had the foresight to convene a \"world assembly on ageing\" back in 1982, but that came and went. By 1994 the World Bank had noticed that something big was happening. In a report entitled \"Averting the Old Age Crisis\", it argued that pension arrangements in most countries were unsustainable.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;For the next ten years a succession of books, mainly by Americans, sounded the alarm. They had titles like Young vs Old, Gray Davn and The Coming Generational Storm, and their message was blunt: health-care systems were heading for the rocks, pensioners were taking young people to the cleaners, and soon there would be intergenerational warfare.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Since then the debate has become less emotional, not least because a lot more is known about the subject. Books, conferences and research papers have multiplied. International organisations such as the OECD and the EU issue regular reports. Population ageing is on every agenda, from G8 economic conferences to NATO summits. The World Economic Forum plans to consider the future of pensions and health care at its prestigious Davos conference early next year. The media, including this newspaper, are giving the subject extensive coverage.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Whether all that attention has translated into sufficient action is another question. Governments in rich countries now accept that their pension and health-care promises will soon become unaffordable, and many of them have embarked on reforms, but so far only timidly. That is not surprising: politicians with an eye on the next election will hardly rush to introduce unpopular measures that may not bear fruit for years, perhaps decades.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The outline of the changes needed is clear. To avoid fiscal(财政的) meltdown, public pensions and health-care provision will have to be reined back severely and taxes may have to go up. By far the most effective method to restrain pension spending is to give people the opportunity to work longer, because it increases tax revenues and reduces spending on pensions at the same time. It may even keep them alive longer. John Rother, the AARP&#39;s head of policy and strategy, points to studies showing that other things being equal, people who remain at work have lower death rates than their retired peers.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Younger people today mostly accept that they will have to work for longer and that their pensions will be less generous. Employers still need to be persuaded that older workers are worth holding on to. That may be because they have had plenty of younger ones to choose from, partly thanks to the post-war baby-boom and partly because over the past few decades many more women have entered the labour force, increasing employers&#39; choice. But the reservoir of women able and willing to take up paid work is running low and the baby-boomers are going grey.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;In many countries immigrants have been filling such gaps in the labour force as have already emerged (and remember that the real shortage is still around ten years off). Immigration in the developed world is the highest it has ever been, and it is making a useful difference. In still-fertile America it currently accounts for about 40% of total population growth, and in fast-ageing western Europe for about 90%.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;On the face of it, it seems the perfect solution Many developing countries have lots of young people in need of jobs; many rich countries need helping hands that will boost tax revenues and keep up economic growth. But over the next few decades labour forces in rich countries are set to shrink so much that inflows of immigrants would have to increase enormously to compensate: to at least twice their current size in western Europe&#39;s most youthful countries, and three times in the older ones. Japan would need a large multiple of the few immigrants it has at present. Public opinion polls show that people in most rich countries already think that immigration is too high. Further big increases would be politically unfeasible.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;To tackle the problem of ageing populations at its root, \"old\" countries would have to rejuvenate (使年轻) themselves by having more of their own children. A number of them have tried, some more successfully than others. But it is not a simple matter of offering financial incentives or providing more child care. Modern urban life in rich countries is not well adapted to large families. Women find it hard to combine family and career. They often compromise by having just one child.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;And if fertility in ageing countries does not pick up? It will not be the end of the world, at least not for quite a while yet, but the world will slowly become a different place. Older societies may be less innovative and more strongly disinclined to take risks than younger ones. By 2025 at the latest, about half the voters in America and most of those in western European countries will be over 50—and older people turn out to vote in much greater number than younger ones. Academic studies have found no evidence so far that older voters have used their power at the ballot box to push for policies that specifically benefit them, though if in future there are many more of them they might start doing so.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor is there any sign of the intergenerational warfare predicted in the 1990s. After all, older people themselves mostly have families. In a recent study of parents and grown-up children in 11 European countries, Karsten Hank of Mannheim University found that 85% of them lived within 25km of each other and the majority of them were in touch at least once a week.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Even so, the shift in the centre of gravity to older age groups is bound to have a profound effect on societies, not just economically and politically but in all sorts of other ways too. Richard Jackson and Neil Howe of America&#39;s CSIS, in a thoughtful book called The Graying of the Great Powers, argue that, among other things, the ageing of the developed countries will have a number of serious security implications.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;For example, the shortage of young adults is likely to make countries more reluctant to commit the few they have to military service. In the decades to 2050, America will find itself playing an ever-increasing role in the developed world&#39;s defence effort. Because America&#39;s population will still be growing when that of most other developed countries is shrinking, America will be the only developed country that still matters geopolitically(地缘政治上).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Ask me in 2020</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;There is little that can be done to stop population ageing, so the world will have to live with it. But some of the consequences can be alleviated. Many experts now believe that given the right policies, the effects, though grave, need not be catastrophic. Most countries have recognised the need to do something and are beginning to act.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;But even then there is no guarantee that their efforts will work. What is happening now is historically unprecedented. Ronald Lee, director of the Centre on the Economics and Demography of Ageing at the University of California, Berkeley, puts it briefly and clearly: \"We don&#39;t really know what population ageing will be like, because nobody has done it yet. \"', '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '0', '', '', '0', '4');

INSERT INTO `exam_question` VALUES ('573', '0', '7', '27', '0.0', ' &nbsp; &nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><strong>Small Schools Rising</strong></div><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;This year&#39;s list of the top 100 high schools shows that today, those with fewer students are flourishing.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Fifty years ago, they were the latest thing in educational reform: big, modem, suburban high schools with students counted in the thousands. As baby boomers (二战后婴儿潮时期出生的人) came of high-school age, big schools promised economic efficiency, a greater choice of courses, and, of course, better football teams. Only years later did we understand the trade-offs this involved: the creation of excessive bureaucracies (官僚机构), the difficulty of forging personal connections between teachers and students. SAT scores began dropping in 1963; today, on average, 30% of students do not complete high school in four years, a figure that rises to 50% in poor urban neighborhoods. While the emphasis on teaching to higher, test-driven standards as set in No Child Left Behind resulted in significantly better performance in elementary (and some middle) schools, high schools for a variety of reasons seemed to have made little progress.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Size isn&#39;t everything, but it does matter, and the past decade has seen a noticeable countertrend toward smaller schools. This has been due, in part, to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has invested $1.8 billion in American high schools, helping to open about 1,000 small schools—most of them with about 400 kids each, with an average enrollment of only 150 per grade. About 500 more are on the drawing board. Districts all over the country are taking notice, along with mayors in cities like New York, Chicago and San Diego. The movement includes independent public charter schools, such as No.1 BASIS in Tucson, with only 120 high-schoolers and 18 graduates this year. It embraces district- sanctioned magnet schools, such as the Talented and Gifted School, with 198 students, and the Science and Engineering Magnet, with 383, which share a building in Dallas, as well as the City Honors School in Buffalo, N.Y., which grew out of volunteer evening seminars for students. And it includes alternative schools with students selected by lottery (抽签), such as H-B Woodlawn in Arlington, Va.And most noticeable of all, there is the phenomenon of large urban and suburban high schools that have split up into smaller units of a few hundred, generally housed in the same grounds that once boasted thousands of students all marching to the same band.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Hillsdale High School in San Mateo, Calif., is one of those, ranking No.423—among the top 2% in the country—on Newsweek&#39;s annual ranking of America&#39;s top high schools. The success of small schools is apparent in the listings. Ten years ago, when the first Newsweek list based on college-level test participation was published, only three of the top 100 schools had graduating classes smaller than 100 students. This year there are 22. Nearly 250 schools on the full Newsweek list of the top 5% of schools nationally had fewer than 200 graduates in 2007.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Although many of Hillsdale&#39;s students came from wealthy households, by the late 1990s average &nbsp;test scores were sliding and it had earned the unaffectionate nickname (绰号) \"Hillsjail\". Jeff Gilbert, a Hillsdale teacher who became principal last year, remembers sitting with other teachers watching students file out a graduation ceremony and asking one another in astonishment, \"How did that student graduate?\"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;So in 2003 Hillsdale remade itself into three \"houses\", romantically named Florence, Marrakech and Kyoto. Each of the 300 arriving ninth grades are randomly (随机地) assigned to one of the houses, where they will keep the same four core subject teachers for two years, before moving on to another for 11th and 12th grades. The closeness this system cultivates is reinforced by the institution of \"advisory\" classes. Teachers meet with students in groups of 25, five mornings a week, for open-ended discussions of everything from homework problems to bad Saturday-night dates. The advisers also meet with students privately and stay in touch with parents, so they are deeply invested in the students&#39; success. \"We&#39;re constantly talking about one another&#39;s advisees,\" says English Teacher Chris Crockett. \"If you hear that yours isn&#39;t doing well in math, or see them sitting outside the dean&#39;s office, it&#39;s like a personal failure.\" Along with the new structure came a more demanding academic program; the percentage of freshmen taking biology jumped from 17 to 95. \"It was rough for some, but by senior year, two-thirds have moved up to physics,\" says Gilbert. \"Our kids are coming to school in part because they know there are adults here who know them and care for them.\" But not all schools show advances after downsizing, and it remains to be seen whether smaller schools will be a cure-all solution.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The Newsweek list of top U.S. high schools was made this year, as in years past, according to a &nbsp;single metric, the proportion of students taking college-level exams. Over the years this system has come in for its share of criticism for its simplicity. But that is also its strength: it&#39;s easy for readers to understand, and to do the arithmetic for their own schools if they&#39;d like.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Ranking schools is always controversial, and this year a group of 38 superintendents (地区教育主管) from five states wrote to ask that their schools be excluded from the calculation. \"It is impossible to know which high schools are &#39;the best &#39;in the nation,\" their letter read, in part. \"Determining whether different schools do or don&#39;t offer a high quality of education requires a look at many different measures, including students&#39; overall academic accomplishments and their subsequent performance in college, and taking into consideration the unique needs of their communities.\"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;In the end, the superintendents agreed to provide the data we sought, which is, after all, public information. There is, in our view, no real dispute here; we are all seeking the same thing, which is schools that better serve our children and our nation by encouraging students to tackle tough subjects under the guidance of gifted teachers. And if we keep working toward that goal, someday, perhaps, a list won&#39;t be necessary.', '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '0', '', '', '0', '6');

INSERT INTO `exam_question` VALUES ('687', '0', '7', '27', '0.0', '<div align=\"center\"><strong>Why Integrity Matters</strong></div><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>What Is Integrity?</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The key to integrity is consistency—not only setting high personal standards for oneself (honesty, responsibility, respect for others, fairness) but also living up to those standards each and every day. One who has integrity is bound by and follows moral and <em>ethical</em> (道德上的) standards even when making life&#39;s hard choices, choices which may be clouded by stress, pressure to succeed, or temptation.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;What happens if we lie, cheat, steal, or violate other ethical standards? We feel disappointed in ourselves and ashamed. But a <em>lapse</em> (缺失) of integrity also affects our relationships with others. Trust is essential in any important relationship, whether personal or professional. Who can trust someone who is dishonest or unfair? Thus, integrity must be one of our most important goals.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Risky Business</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;We are each responsible for our own decisions, even if the decision-making process has been undermined by stress or peer pressure. The real test of character is whether we can learn from our mistake, by understanding why we acted as we did and then exploring ways to avoid similar problems in the future.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Making ethical decisions is a critical part of avoiding future problems. We must learn to recognize risks, because if we can&#39;t see the risks we&#39;re taking, we can&#39;t make responsible choices. To identify risks, we need to know the rules and be aware of the facts. For example, one who doesn&#39;t know the rules about <em>plagiarism</em> (剽窃) may accidentally use words or ideas without giving proper credit, or one who fails to keep careful research notes may unintentionally fail to quote and cite sources as required. But the fact that such a violation is \"unintentional\" does not excuse the misconduct. Ignorance is not a defense.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>\"But Everybody Does It\"</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Most people who get in trouble do know the rules and facts but manage to fool themselves about the risks they&#39;re taking by using excuses: \"Everyone else does it,\" \"I&#39;m not hurting anyone,\" or \"I really need this grade.\" Excuses can get very elaborate: \"I know I&#39;m looking at another&#39;s exam, but that&#39;s not cheating because I&#39;m just checking my answers, not copying.\" We must be honest about our actions and avoid excuses. If we fool ourselves into believing we&#39;re not doing anything wrong, we can&#39;t see the real choice we&#39;re making—and that leads to bad decisions.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;To avoid fooling yourself, watch out for excuses and try this test: Ask how you would feel if your actions were public and anyone could be watching over your shoulder. If you&#39;d rather hide your actions, that&#39;s an indication that you&#39;re taking a risk and rationalizing it to yourself.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Evaluating Risks</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;To decide whether a risk is worth taking, you must examine the consequences, in the future as well as right now, negative as well as positive, and to others as well as to yourself. Those who take risks they later regret usually focus on immediate benefits and simply haven&#39;t considered what might go wrong. The consequences of getting caught are serious and may include a \"0\" on a test or assignment, an \"F\" in the class, <em>suspension</em> (暂令停学) or dismissal from school and a ruined reputation. In fact, when you break a rule or law, you lose control over your life and give others the power to impose punishment that you have no control over. This is an extremely <em>vulnerable</em> (脆弱的) position. There may be some matters of life and death or highest principle, which might justify such a risk, but there aren&#39;t many things that fall in this category.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Getting Away With It—Or Not</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Those who don&#39;t get caught pay an even higher price. A cheater doesn&#39;t learn from the test, which <em>deprives</em> (剥夺) him/her of an education. Cheating undermines confidence and independence; the cheater is a fraud, and knows that without dishonesty, he/she would have failed. Cheating destroys self- respect and integrity, leaving the cheater ashamed, guilty, and afraid of getting caught. Worst of all, a cheater who doesn&#39;t get caught the first time usually cheats again, not only because he/she is farther behind, but also because it seems \"easier.\" This slippery slope of eroding ethics and bigger risks leads only to disaster. Eventually, the cheater gets caught, and the later he/she gets caught, the worse the consequences.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Cheating Hurts Others, Too</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Cheaters often feel invisible, as if their actions \"don&#39;t count\" and don&#39;t really hurt anyone. But individual choices have an intense <em>cumulative</em> (累积的) effect. Cheating can spread like a disease. Recent statistics suggest 30% or more of college students cheat. If a class is graded on a curve, cheating hurts others&#39; grades. Even if there is no curve, cheating \"poisons\" the classroom, and others may feel pressured to join in. (\"If I don&#39;t cheat, I can&#39;t compete with those who do.\" ) Cheating also has a destructive impact on teachers. The real reward of good teaching is seeing students learn, but a cheater says, \"I&#39;m not interested in what you&#39;re trying to teach; all I care about is stealing a grade, regardless of the effect on others.\" The end result is a destructive attack on the quality of your education. Finally, cheating can hurt the reputation of the university and harm those who worked hard for their degree.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Why Integrity Matters</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;If cheating becomes the norm, then we are in big trouble. We must rely on the honesty and good faith of others. If not, we couldn&#39;t put money in the bank, buy food, clothing or medicine from others, drive across a bridge, get on a plane, go to the dentist—the list is endless. There are many examples of the vast harm that is caused when individuals forget or ignore the effect their dishonesty can have. The savings and loan scandal, the stock market and junk bond swindles, and, of course, Watergate, have undermined the faith of many Americans in the integrity of political and economic leaders and society as a whole. Such incidents take a tremendous toll on our nation&#39;s economy and our individual well- being. For example, but for the savings and loan debacle, there might be funds available to reduce the national debt and pay for education.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;In sum, we all have a common stake in our school, our community, and our society. Our actions do matter. It is essential that we act with integrity in order to build the kind of world in which we want to live.', '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '0', '', '', '0', '7');

INSERT INTO `exam_question` VALUES ('801', '0', '7', '27', '0.0', '<div align=\"center\"><strong>Why Integrity Matters</strong></div><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>What Is Integrity?</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The key to integrity is consistency—not only setting high personal standards for oneself (honesty, responsibility, respect for others, fairness) but also living up to those standards each and every day. One who has integrity is bound by and follows moral and <em>ethical</em> (道德上的) standards even when making life&#39;s hard choices, choices which may be clouded by stress, pressure to succeed, or temptation.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;What happens if we lie, cheat, steal, or violate other ethical standards? We feel disappointed in ourselves and ashamed. But a <em>lapse</em> (缺失) of integrity also affects our relationships with others. Trust is essential in any important relationship, whether personal or professional. Who can trust someone who is dishonest or unfair? Thus, integrity must be one of our most important goals.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Risky Business</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;We are each responsible for our own decisions, even if the decision-making process has been undermined by stress or peer pressure. The real test of character is whether we can learn from our mistake, by understanding why we acted as we did and then exploring ways to avoid similar problems in the future.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Making ethical decisions is a critical part of avoiding future problems. We must learn to recognize risks, because if we can&#39;t see the risks we&#39;re taking, we can&#39;t make responsible choices. To identify risks, we need to know the rules and be aware of the facts. For example, one who doesn&#39;t know the rules about <em>plagiarism</em> (剽窃) may accidentally use words or ideas without giving proper credit, or one who fails to keep careful research notes may unintentionally fail to quote and cite sources as required. But the fact that such a violation is \"unintentional\" does not excuse the misconduct. Ignorance is not a defense.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>\"But Everybody Does It\"</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Most people who get in trouble do know the rules and facts but manage to fool themselves about the risks they&#39;re taking by using excuses: \"Everyone else does it,\" \"I&#39;m not hurting anyone,\" or \"I really need this grade.\" Excuses can get very elaborate: \"I know I&#39;m looking at another&#39;s exam, but that&#39;s not cheating because I&#39;m just checking my answers, not copying.\" We must be honest about our actions and avoid excuses. If we fool ourselves into believing we&#39;re not doing anything wrong, we can&#39;t see the real choice we&#39;re making—and that leads to bad decisions.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;To avoid fooling yourself, watch out for excuses and try this test: Ask how you would feel if your actions were public and anyone could be watching over your shoulder. If you&#39;d rather hide your actions, that&#39;s an indication that you&#39;re taking a risk and rationalizing it to yourself.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Evaluating Risks</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;To decide whether a risk is worth taking, you must examine the consequences, in the future as well as right now, negative as well as positive, and to others as well as to yourself. Those who take risks they later regret usually focus on immediate benefits and simply haven&#39;t considered what might go wrong. The consequences of getting caught are serious and may include a \"0\" on a test or assignment, an \"F\" in the class, <em>suspension</em> (暂令停学) or dismissal from school and a ruined reputation. In fact, when you break a rule or law, you lose control over your life and give others the power to impose punishment that you have no control over. This is an extremely <em>vulnerable</em> (脆弱的) position. There may be some matters of life and death or highest principle, which might justify such a risk, but there aren&#39;t many things that fall in this category.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Getting Away With It—Or Not</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Those who don&#39;t get caught pay an even higher price. A cheater doesn&#39;t learn from the test, which <em>deprives</em> (剥夺) him/her of an education. Cheating undermines confidence and independence; the cheater is a fraud, and knows that without dishonesty, he/she would have failed. Cheating destroys self- respect and integrity, leaving the cheater ashamed, guilty, and afraid of getting caught. Worst of all, a cheater who doesn&#39;t get caught the first time usually cheats again, not only because he/she is farther behind, but also because it seems \"easier.\" This slippery slope of eroding ethics and bigger risks leads only to disaster. Eventually, the cheater gets caught, and the later he/she gets caught, the worse the consequences.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Cheating Hurts Others, Too</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Cheaters often feel invisible, as if their actions \"don&#39;t count\" and don&#39;t really hurt anyone. But individual choices have an intense <em>cumulative</em> (累积的) effect. Cheating can spread like a disease. Recent statistics suggest 30% or more of college students cheat. If a class is graded on a curve, cheating hurts others&#39; grades. Even if there is no curve, cheating \"poisons\" the classroom, and others may feel pressured to join in. (\"If I don&#39;t cheat, I can&#39;t compete with those who do.\" ) Cheating also has a destructive impact on teachers. The real reward of good teaching is seeing students learn, but a cheater says, \"I&#39;m not interested in what you&#39;re trying to teach; all I care about is stealing a grade, regardless of the effect on others.\" The end result is a destructive attack on the quality of your education. Finally, cheating can hurt the reputation of the university and harm those who worked hard for their degree.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Why Integrity Matters</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;If cheating becomes the norm, then we are in big trouble. We must rely on the honesty and good faith of others. If not, we couldn&#39;t put money in the bank, buy food, clothing or medicine from others, drive across a bridge, get on a plane, go to the dentist—the list is endless. There are many examples of the vast harm that is caused when individuals forget or ignore the effect their dishonesty can have. The savings and loan scandal, the stock market and junk bond swindles, and, of course, Watergate, have undermined the faith of many Americans in the integrity of political and economic leaders and society as a whole. Such incidents take a tremendous toll on our nation&#39;s economy and our individual well- being. For example, but for the savings and loan debacle, there might be funds available to reduce the national debt and pay for education.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;In sum, we all have a common stake in our school, our community, and our society. Our actions do matter. It is essential that we act with integrity in order to build the kind of world in which we want to live.', '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '0', '', '', '0', '8');
